## Services and Simulators

- [Quantum Computing Playground](http://www.quantumplayground.net/#/home) This one looks like a nice introduction to quantum computing wiout getting distracted learning syntactical details.
- AWS Bracket. Sent requent to use their hardware
- [D Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/) I have been approved for 20 minutes of free compute time on actual quantum hardware:smile:
- Azure Sent requent to use their hardware
- [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/) Approved. Free simulation
- [QC Ware](https://forge.qcware.com/) Free trial
- [Quantum Inspire](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/about-qi) Quantum compute provider

## arXiv and articles

- [Quantum Computing Overview](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/introduction-to-quantum-computing) series of web articles on quantum computing. Funny and provides plenty of examples.
- [Performing Quantum Computing Experiments in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05709)
